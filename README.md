## Getting Started

Type the following into your terminal.

```sh
npm init marko
```

This command will give you a selection of examples to pick from.

After picking a example, it will be downloaded and all dependencies will be installed.
For most examples, you can quickly get up and running by using the following commands:

```sh
cd ./my-app
npm run dev
```

If this command is missing, review the `README.md` for the chosen example.
