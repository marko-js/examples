## Getting Started
### Step 1

```console
foo@bar:$ npx @marko/create my-app
```

This command will give you a selection of examples to pick from.

### Step 2
After picking a example, it will be downloaded and all dependencies will be installed.
For most examples, you can quickly get up and running by using the following command:

```console
foo@bar:$ cd ./my-app
foo@bar:$ npm run dev
```

If this command is missing, review the `README.md` for the chosen example.
